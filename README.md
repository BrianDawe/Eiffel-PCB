# Eiffel-PCB

This is my implementation of the Eiffel PS2 keyboard/mouse adapter for the Mega ST/TT computers

This repo contains the KiCAD project files and all gerbers needed to make the PCB's

The original Eiffel project was created by Didier MÃ©quignon and can be found here https://didierm.pagesperso-orange.fr/eiffel-e.htm
